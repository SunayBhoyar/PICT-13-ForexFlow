Overview :
    The application is a Flask web server that processes CSV files. It performs the following steps:

    1. Reads a CSV file from the client.
    2. Extracts the year and generates date ranges based on the 'Date' column.
    3. Identifies missing dates in the original data.
    4. Reindexes the DataFrame with a new date range.
    5. Fills missing values in the DataFrame using forward fill, backward fill, and the mean of a window.
    6. Adds '*' to the values that were filled.
    7. Drops the original columns except 'Date'.
    8. Optionally saves the processed DataFrame to a new CSV file.

Endpoints:
    POST /process_csv: Accepts a CSV file upload, processes it, and returns processing results.

                'result': Processed DataFrame in JSON format
